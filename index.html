                What is Chip/ IC(integrated circuit) Fabrication
            </h2>
            <p>
                Chip's Are Nothing But It's Semi-Conductor Devices, Semi-Conductor Device Fabrication It Is The Process Of Manufacturing
                The SILICON Chip. A Semi-Conductor Chip Is an Electric Circuit With Mnay Components Such As Transitor 
                And Wiring Formed On That Silicon WaferAsiliver Slilicon Chip Is Smaller Than A postage Stamp,
                Which It Contains The Million's To Billion Transitor's These Transistor Are ACting Like On OFF SWITCHE's.
                The Transistor Are The Fundamental Active Components On That Chip.

            <h2>Who Is The Inventor?</h2>

            <h4>Have You Ever Heard Of "Jack Killby"? His Nmae May Not Be Recognizable,But His Invention Impacts Virtually Every Moment Of Our Lives. In Fact, You Are Benifiting From Jack Killby's Technology As You Read This Artical.</h4>

            <p> <b>jack killby</b> (1923-2005) was an electrical engineer who joined texas instrument in the summer of 1958. because he was a new employee and had not acumulated enough vaccation time, he stayed in the office while the rest of his department took it's annual two week vacation in july.
            <br>

            killby styudied how to effictively and fficiently reduce the numbers. "Evry Computer Of That Time had Miles and  Miles of wiring and jack said , 'why do we need the wires?  if i make the parts all out of the same material, i could just carve them into one block of that material and....no wires.'"

            <br>

            by inventing the integrated circuit (IC), now commnoly called the microchip, jack killby reduced the miles of wireing to one. jack killby invention of the integrated circuit was the geneius of almost evry electronic product used today. from cell phones to modems, to internet audio players, the chip has changed the world. killby recived the nobale prize in physics on december 10 2000. for his part of invention of integrated circuit.
